OpenMMA (<i>member management</i> and <i>administration</i>) is an open source system, which means the code is freely accessible to everyone to use and adapt as desired. The project was started based on the philosophy that everyone should have access to good code, and to offer an alternative to existing commercial member management systems. In short: free software which you can adapt entirely to your needs!</p>

                            You may wonder why we make the code for OpenMMA freely available. We did this based on the idea that code is not something to earn money with, but something to help people move forward. With open source code, everyone can see exactly how software works, which means there won't be any shady practices, as they would get discovered quickly. Openness and transparency are very important!

                                The system is still in the development phase, and we are working hard to create a usable version as soon as possible. Our current goal is to have this done by <b>early April</b>. This version will include all base functionality that is described below, and after that we will quickly be adding more features! Do you have any ideas or suggestions for features that you would like to see in the final product? Please contact us, so we can take them into account!

                                Of course, this is dependent on your current system. The first version will have limited functionality, as we prioritize to deliver a usable product as soon as possible. This version will include: member administration, member accounts and a event calendar. In the following months we will be adding as many other features as possible. And the nice thing is: since we are still in this phase of development, we can take your wishes and needs into account during development!

                                In short, with the first version it will be possible to have member accounts (and for new members to create their own accounts), the ability to create groups and to have roles inside these groups, planning of events/activities and a registration option for members to register for these events, keeping track of additional member information like education programmes or addresses (which information exactly can be configured), and importing accounts from external systems. After this, we will start implementing other features, like integrating payment options, custom layouts and designs, integration with for example Wordpress but also the ability to manage your whole website through OpenMMA, and more! Again, if there are any requests for features we would love to take these into account! 
                                An overview of planned functionalities can also be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/users/Eaorns/projects/3">GitHub</a>.

                                OpenMMA will offer you the same functionality as a commercial product, but free! On top of that, you do not have to worry about 'premium'-memberships. You also support the open source philosophy and can adapt the system entirely to your requirements, either by people with some technical skills inside your association, or with some help from us or another external party. For open source projects, the community is very important. The more users there are, the better the system will get because of the attention it gets and the people it attracts that way, who may contribute to the project.

                                For a small fee, we can customize your system to your wishes and make it available, so you can start using it. We can also organize hosting for you, and offer an option for support. Besides this, we develop websites and IT-solutions for various companies; we would love to hear it if you also would be interested in this!
